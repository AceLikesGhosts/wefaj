- wefaj.. keyboard spam.

## The Goal:
The goal of `wefaj` is to *(badly)* provide TypeScript type documentation for [Zachary Mitchell's](https://github.com/zachmitchell) poorly written 
JavaScript projects. 

## Todo:
✔ [Stateful](https://github.com/zachMitchell/lemonBot/tree/master/stateful) <br>
✔ [Bot-Cooldown](https://github.com/zachMitchell/bot-cooldown) <br>
- `Bot Cooldown` actually has the declaration file merged into it! <br>
❌ [LemonBot](https://github.com/zachMitchell/lemonbot) <br>
❌ [LemonBot Modules](https://github.com/zachMitchell/lemonBot/tree/master/lemonModules)
